    Explaining the NAO
    <ul> 
   <il> The NAO is a climate phenomena caused by changes in permanent regions of high and low air pressure over the North Atlantic. 
    <li>The high pressure region is located over Portugal and the low pressure region is over Iceland.</li>
    <li> But what is air pressure? Air pressure is defined as the amount of force exerted by air on a small section of the Earth’s surface. In this case, it is the weight of air over Portugal and Iceland.</li>
    <li>Some years have a strong or positive NAO and others a weak or negative one. A positive NAO phase is when there is a big difference between the high and low pressure regions (as seen in figure …) . Consequently, a negative phase means there is a smaller difference between the high and low pressures.</li>
    </ul>
        

    How does the NAO impact climate?
    <ul>  
    <il>Strong and weak NAO patterns lead to differences in climate  across the North Atlantic particularly in the winter.</il>
    <li> In the negative phase, the Mediterranean and Northern African have wetter and milder winters because the winds blowing towards the west from the tropics bring warm water and moisture to this region. Europe and North America, in contrast, are colder and drier during the winter.</li> 
    <li>During the positive phase, the winds get stronger and shift towards Europe. Winters here and in North America are cold and windy while winters in the Mediteranean and Northern Africa are hot and dry</li>
    </ul>  

    
    
    We are studying the NAO’s impact on the ocean because...  
    <ul> 
    <il>The NAO can influence surface ocean circulation and temperature  through its impact on atmospheric circulation</il>
    <li>The impact of climate change on the NAO is not well-understood</il>
    <li>Human emissions of greenhouse gases drive climate change by confining more heat energy from the Sun.  The ocean traps more than 90% of  this heat. This results in an increase of sea temperature and sea levels. The change in ocean temperature can alter life around us. For example, warmer ocean waters result in stronger tropical storms which damage property and loss of lives. Climate change can also alter natural climate phenomena, like the NAO, that influence the ocean but these impacts are still being understood.</il>
    </ul>
